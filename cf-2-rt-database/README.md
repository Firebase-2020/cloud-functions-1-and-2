Note: This is a continueation from [cloud-functions-1-firecasts](https://github.com/Firebase-2020/cloud-functions-1-firecasts). There we stoped on lecture 7  because we had to use Real Time Database and on that project we were using Firebase...

### lecture 7
- [Realtime Database triggers (pt. 1) with Cloud Functions for Firebase - Firecasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DglTSNEdl0U&list=PLl-K7zZEsYLkPZHe41m4jfAxUi0JjLgSM&index=8&t=0s)

Cloud Functions allows you to write code that responds to changes in your Realtime Database.  Doug explains how these triggers work on the backend, and focuses on the onCreate event handler,  which triggers when new data is created in the Realtime Database. Stay tuned for future Cloud Function videos, which will focus on the onUpdate, and onDelete triggers.
